## Acknowledgement
I have not designed the writing chinese js library Hanziwriter. It comes from the awesome [Hanziwriter](https://hanziwriter.org) JavaScript library. 

The chinese character and stroke order data used by [Hanziwriter](https://github.com/chanind/hanzi-writer)
is derived from [ Make me a Hanzi](https://github.com/skishore/makemeahanzi).
  
## Disclaimer
 This implementation is in javascript. It works because Anki uses webview for flashcard review. It may not work on some devices. Please make backups of your decks with scheduling information before importing xiehanzi hsk decks.
 Some audio files missing but using a simple python script audio file can be generated using text to speech. [Read](https://github.com/krmanik/gtts-textToMp3)
